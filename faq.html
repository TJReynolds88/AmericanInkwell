                <lh>Minors may get certain piercings with the following:</lh>
                <li>Your legal guardian must be present to fill out the standard paperwork and both the minor and the
                    adult must have ID.</li>
                <li>The minors ID (Drivers, FOID, Passport, or School ID) must have a picture of the person and name
                    (Medical cards, driving permits, and Social Security cards WILL NOT work as a minors ID)</li>
                <li>Minors must conscientiously ask for the piercings and be old enough to understand and follow the
                    basic healing regimen, we WILL NOT pierce infants and toddlers.</li>

            <h2>When can I get pierced?</h2>
            <p>Any time we are open during normal business hours. Walk-ins are always welcome for piercings, but it does
                not hurt to call to see if the piercer is in and available, or if you are interested in pricing.</p>

            <h2>How do I go about setting up an appointment for a tattoo?</h2>
            <p>Appointments can only be set in-person. <strong>American Inkwell WILL NOT set any tattoo appointments
                    over the phone.</strong> We require a 50% deposit/retainer to be left to schedule any appointments
                with either artist. Deposits left will go towards total price of work unless 24 hrs notice is not given
                to cancel your appointment. American Inkwell WILL NOT refund any money left for tattoo appointments.</p>

            <h2>Do you do walk-ins for tattoos?</h2>
            <p>Walk-ins are welcome, but based on availability of artist. We strongly suggest calling ahead to check for
                any open time the artists might have.</p>
